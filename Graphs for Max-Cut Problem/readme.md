Here is a README file for the "Graphs for Max-Cut Problem" folder and its subfolders:

# Graphs for Max-Cut Problem

This folder contains the graph data used to generate the QAOA Max-Cut circuits in the dataset. 

There are a total of 813 graphs across 3 subfolders corresponding to graphs with 3, 4, and 5 nodes. Each graph meets the criteria for the Max-Cut problem - every node is connected to at least one edge.

## Data Structure

The graphs are organized into the following subfolders:

**3_node_graphs**: Contains 4 total 3-node graphs for Max-Cut 

**4_node_graphs**: Contains 41 total 4-node graphs for Max-Cut

**5_node_graphs**: Contains 768 total 5-node graphs for Max-Cut
